Description: We present two 'Shiny' apps for the teaching and 
    exploration of Calcium (Ca) and Phosphate (Pi) homeostasis, building upon on a previously published 
    mathematical model written in C, to ensure efficient computations. The underlying model is accessible
    here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747359>.
    The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis, 
    while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic, 
    thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation. 
    These applications are hosted on RStudio Connect at <http://physiol-seafile.uzh.ch> and 
    the design is powered by RinteRface <https://rinterface.com>.
