               At start, only Ca arrow are displayed without any regulation. This 
               can be changed from the navigation bar above. It is also possible to
               select the model to use: either rat or human, with the corresponding
               background. Once a case study is selected initial perturbations are 
               shown in yellow. The arrow size increases if it is a stimulatory 
               effect and inversely. Fluxes are shown in red if they 
               decrease or in green if they are enhanced. Color corresponds to the final 
               state of the system (see graph on the right).",

               of the simulation (orange vertical line in the graph). It only works
               for dynamic simulations and not steady-state ones. Besides, you 
               can also use the back and next buttons of the diagram section,

               details about the experimental conditions of simulations. 
               When you select Calcium infusion, PO4 injection or PO4 gavage, 
               a slider input bar will be displayed to enable you to control the current time."
